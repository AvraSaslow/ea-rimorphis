# Earth Lab + RIMORPHIS

_Authors: Avra Saslow & Kristen Tortorelli_

This repository is for a research project focused on improving flood detection with a focus on comparing stream gage discharge data against satellite imagery to determine at which point we can detect overbank flooding. We're working in conjunction with the NSF funded project [RIMORPHIS](https://rimorphis.org/) to ultimately assist in modeling streamflow and sediment transport across the US.

This workflow utilizes both Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the National Water Information System (NWIS)

Additional "explorations" notebooks have been included showing more of the process completed to finalize the workflow.
